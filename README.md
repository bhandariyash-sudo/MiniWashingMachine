# MiniWashingMachine
This project simulates a fully functional mini washing machine built around the ATmega2560 microcontroller. It integrates stepper motor control, servo door actuation, push-button user input, and LED bar indicators to mimic real washing machine operations such as washing, rinsing, and spinning.
